Here's an awesome use for CSS nth-child rules that I learned recently.

Here goes:

On a page there are some buttons.

There might be up to three buttons.

Style appropriately.

## Option One: Javascript

So we count the number of boxes, then add a class such as one-of-three to assign some width-dependent CSS. Something like this:

```javascript
var wrapper = document.getElementById("div.buttonWrap");
var count = wrapper.childElementCount();
wrapper.classList.add("children-" + count);
```

This isnâ€™t bad. Sure, itâ€™ll work, but what if we could remove that JavaScript altogether? What if we can do this with just HTML and CSS?

## A Better Way

Or at least more interesting.

I was hunting around for a better way to do this that didnâ€™t involve going into JS at all, and I found one. [This idea](https://lea.verou.me/2011/01/styling-children-based-on-their-number-with-css3/) from Lea Verou is just what I need, and Iâ€™ll try to explain it to you.
To get the ball rolling lets do a little thought experiment.

Something about proportional amounts.

To start with letâ€™s line up our variables. We donâ€™t know how many buttons we have. We do know how much space we have and we also know that if we have three buttons we want them to be a third each, halves for two, and one button would be full-width. Now removing JS means we encounter an issue: CSS canâ€™t count. Or at least it canâ€™t tell us. We canâ€™t say tell us how many there are and if thereâ€™s three, do something.

But CSS can (and will) tell us some things about the position of individuals. We can specifically target:

- `first-child` â€“ the first one
- `last-child` â€“ the last one
- `nth-child` â€“ the nth one. You can also substitute n for an equation to get every one after the second (`n + 3`), every second one (`2n`) the even ones (`even`) and odd ones.
- `nth-last-child(n)` â€“ now this one is interesting. This pseudo selector gets the nth from last. So if `n = 2`, thatâ€™s the second to last. This can help us in our situation.

> NB. There are more of these. [CSS tricks has a great reference](https://css-tricks.com/useful-nth-child-recipies/). With pictures!

Letâ€™s say we have just the one button. In this case this button is both the first and the last. We can target that example.

```css
.button:first-child:last-child {
  width: 100%;
}
```

Itâ€™s the first child, and itâ€™s the last child. So itâ€™s targeted!

Now is the clever bit, using that `nth-last-child` selector we looked at. Letâ€™s say thereâ€™s two now. The first one is `first-child`, and the last one is `last-child`. But that first one is now also `nth-last-child(2)`. this way, without CSS telling us thereâ€™s two buttons, we can target the first button only when there are two buttons. Any more or less than that, our CSS wonâ€™t apply.

```css
// When there's two boxes, the first one is the second-from-last
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(2) {
  width: 50%;
}
// When there's three, the first is third-from-last
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(3) {
  width: 33.33%;
}
```

Similarly, if we have three, the first-child will be the `nth-last-child(3)` as well, so we can target that.

Then we just need to target the other buttons to make them the same size too. Luckily we have our trusty `~` selector, which selects all siblings of an element of a given element type, like this:

```css
// When there's two boxes, the first one is the second-from-last
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(2),
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(2) ~ .box {
  width: 50%;
}
// When there's three, the first is third-from-last
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(3),
.button:first-child:nth-last-child(3) ~ .box {
  width: 33.33%;
}
```

And thatâ€™s it! Itâ€™s a handy little CSS solution for a JavaScript problem. And no, this wouldnâ€™t be many good for more than a possible three buttons because youâ€™d have to write lots of repetitive CSS. And the JavaScript impact is pretty small. This is just a neat CSS-nerd trick I found, and I love it.

<div>
  <p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rossdw" data-slug-hash="ppvwzN" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="All-CSS Widths depending on div quantity">
    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rossdw/pen/ppvwzN">

  </p>

</div>

## Bonus Ball

Nowadays with CSS variables and modern techniques there might be a way to look over that first selector with numbers 1â€“3. If there is drop me a comment! If thereâ€™s an even better way, or you just prefer the JavaScript way Iâ€™d like to hear about that too. Is this unnecessarily complicated for the real world or is it one step away from being useful? Let me know!
