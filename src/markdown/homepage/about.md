## I work in _Javascript, CSS and HTML_. Here's a bit more about me

I built my first crappy _WordPress_ website at 18. I have a BA that nobody's ever asked me about and I've had a lot of jobs in software, from WordPress Agency Development to React Dev for a major car company to making internal tools in a SAAS company. I _love to learn_ and _build stuff_.

I work for [_Hotjar_](https://hotjar.com), making internal tools and debugging users' websites. Hotjar is the best, and they have some crazy perks. [We're always hiring](https://hotjar.com/careers).

If you need any work doing, you're hosting a local web meet-up or you're looking for speakers, _please get in touch with me_!
