## Here's some _toys_ I've made. Like a creepy idea graveyard.

* [Christmas Movie Picker](https://whichchristmasmovie.netlify.app/) - My wife and I have a very hard time picking movies. Especially at Christmas.
* [Pok√©mon Type-o-dex](https://type-o-dex.netlify.app/) - I play too many video games.
* [RossWhitehouse.com MK.I](http://www.wonderdogdeveloper.com/) - An old WordPress project I used for an early portfolio. Please don't look.
