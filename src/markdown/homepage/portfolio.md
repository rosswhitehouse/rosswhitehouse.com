## Here's some of the things I've made. Some for _love_, some for _money_!  

* [Land Rover/Jaguar Finance Calculator](https://financecalculator.landrover.com/lr/en/gb/models) - I currently work for Connect Group on the JLR finance calculator. This is a _React/Redux_ app using ES6, Babel, Flow and a _JAM Stack_.
* [TheBusinessDesk.com](http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/) - In a previous job I designed and build a _WordPress multisite_ for a Birmingham-based business journalism company.
* [Dribuild Construction](https://dribuild.com/) - As an _agency developer_ I built several WordPress sites for local businesses including this one for Dribuild construction.


* This website right here! It's a JAM-Stack site build on _Gatsby.JS_, with a Contentful CMS and hosted on Netlify.
* [Angular Blog](http://wonderdogdeveloper.com/dev/blog/) - An exercise to use the _Angular-CLI_ using data, showing and hiding components and routing.
* [Vue Monster Game!](https://codepen.io/rossdw/pen/Njrmob) - A fun project I learned on a Udemy course, sort of like _Pokemon_ but cooler cos I made it in _Vue.js_!
* [RossWhitehouse.com MK.I](http://www.wonderdogdeveloper.com/) - An old WordPress project I used for an early portfolio. Please don't look.
